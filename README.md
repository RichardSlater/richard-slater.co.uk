# Richard Slater's Personal Website

This is the public repository for my personal website, whilst all words are my own I do accept pull requests for the following reasons:

- Typographical, spelling and grammar correction.
- Correction of dead links, either to their new canonical location or a archive.org mirror.
- Improvements to code: CSS, HTML, Hugo Shortcodes.
- Corrections to text where what I have written is **provably** wrong.

If you are kind enough to want to contribute, then please send a pull request.
