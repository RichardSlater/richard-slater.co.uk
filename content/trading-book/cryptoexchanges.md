I have compiled this list of Cryptocurrency Exchanges that I use and recommend. Some are better than others but each have their own distinct advantages.

When selecting a cryptocurrency exchange it is important to remember the following:

1. **Do your own research** - I don't mean to be rude, but you should not trust everyone's view - look for different viewpoints and consider talking to a qualified professional.
2. **Consider the security options** - Modern cryptocurrency exchanges are very secure, however there is still a chance that their hot wallets could be compromised. Equally if you don't enable all relevant security settings your account could be compromised and you could lose everything.
3. **Consider trading fees** - these vary wildly from 0.075% (Binance) to 0.5% (Coinbase).
