summary: The Sony α6600 has become my go-to photography camera. Well-rounded for photography, videography, and as a streaming camera or live broadcasts to Facebook Live and Youtube.

{{< amazon-affiliate-image title="sony-α6600" size="large" align="right" >}}My Sony Alpha α6600 pulls triple duty in my hands:

The Sony α6600 sits at the top end of Sony's mid-range E-mount mirrorless cameras. I've found it a true workhorse for content creators, photographers, or videographers.

1. **Webcam** - While I am in my office, it is my full-time webcam, coupled with an {{< amazon-affiliate-link asin="B07K3FN5MR" text="Elgato Cam Link 4K" >}}.
1. **Photography** - with its APS-C sensor, in-body image stabilization, sizable buffer, and fast write speeds, the α6600 makes for a solid general-purpose photography camera.
1. **Videography** - the α6600 is capable of recording 4K at 30fps, HD at 120fps, and no limits to duration, thermal or otherwise. The α6600 makes for a decent family video device.

## Replacing the Logitech BRIO

Having worked from home since January 2019 due to breaking my leg, I had my eye on a Sony mirrorless camera to take over from my {{< amazon-affiliate-link asin="B0748NCPN5" text="Logitech BRIO 4K Stream Edition" >}}.

The Logitech BRIO is an excellent webcam. However, the image contains noticeable noise, making chroma keying harder.

When looking at cameras, I was looking for three things:

1. A sharp image.
1. Clean HDMI output.
1. Unlimited runtime.

### Image Sharpness

I need a camera capable of an absolute minimum of 30 frames per second. 4K output is beneficial as chroma-keying has cleaner pixels to work with before downscaling to High-Definition (1080p or 720p).

What you need depends very much on your pipeline and output:

* **Video Conferencing** - is typically limited to 1080p30 at most; Zoom is capable of 1080p30; however, Teams and Google Hangouts are currently only capable of 720p30 on a good day.
* **Livestreaming** - technically you can live stream to YouTube and some other services at 4K. However, on the modern internet, this is probably pointless. Most viewers cannot view your stream in its full glory, forcing the streaming platform to transcode your stream down to 1080p.
* **Green-Screening** - technically called Chroma-Keying, this is the process of making parts of your image transparent, allowing you to superimpose the subject on a backdrop. Again, 4K is preferable for chroma-keying as there is a sharp transition between green and non-green pixels allowing for a clean chroma-key.
* **Content Reuse** - I highly recommend recording livestreams in the highest resolution possible. This allows you to repurpose your streams for other platforms. Reuse is less of an issue on YouTube with a landscape layout. However, when it comes to portrait media such as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok you need to be able to reframe your short and wide landscape content to be tall and thin portrait content.

### Clean HDMI Output

The camera must be able to output a clean HDMI image without custom firmware, and thus warranty-voiding firmware updates.

### Unlimited Runtime

Finally, the camera must be able to record or output to HDMI without overheating for unlimited time.
