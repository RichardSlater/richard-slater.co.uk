The Sony α6600 sits at the top end of Sony's mid-range E-mount mirrorless cameras. I've found it a true workhorse for content creators, photographers, or videographers. Read on to find out why I love this camera and how I chose it from the myriad of others.

## Why should you buy a general-purpose camera?

A camera can be a significant investment. When I was in the market for a new stream camera, I wanted something that could pull triple duty in my hands. The more I use it, the more I can justify the expense.

The camera needed to be at least decent for all three of my uses: stream, stills, and videography camera. Read on to determine the critical factors for choosing a general-purpose camera and the camera I eventually settled upon.

### A general-purpose stream camera or a webcam

Five years ago, my idea of a webcam was the little cut out hole on the top of laptop screens. When I started to get into live streaming, I rapidly realised that these tiny cameras have some severe limitations.

## How does the Sony α6600 meet my needs?

### The Sony Alpha A6600 is a fantastic webcam or stream camera

I needed a full-time webcam for my home office, coupled with an {{< amazon-affiliate-link asin="B07K3FN5MR" text="Elgato Cam Link 4K" >}} to al.

### As a stills photography camera

I love my {{< amazon-affiliate-link asin="B01MCV43GV" text="Nikon D5300" >}}. However, I bought it when mirrorless cameras were still in the minority, the Nikon lacks the features of many modern cameras.

### As a video camera

DSLRs are capable of producing good videos. However, they are often limited by runtime due to overheating or built-in shutoffs.

### Webcams

Having worked from home since January 2019 due to breaking my leg, I had my eye on a Sony mirrorless camera to take over from my {{< amazon-affiliate-link asin="B0748NCPN5" text="Logitech BRIO 4K Stream Edition" >}}.

The Logitech BRIO is an excellent webcam. However, the image contains noticeable noise, making chroma keying harder.

When looking at cameras for streaming or video conferencing, I looked for image sharpness, clean HDMI output, and unlimited runtime.

### Image Sharpness

I need a camera capable of an absolute minimum of 30 frames per second. 4K output is beneficial as chroma-keying has cleaner pixels to work with before downscaling to High-Definition (1080p or 720p).

What you need depends very much on your pipeline and output:

* **Video Conferencing** - is typically limited to 1080p30 at most; Zoom is capable of 1080p30; however, Teams and Google Hangouts are currently only capable of 720p30 on a good day.
* **Livestreaming** - technically you can live stream to YouTube and some other services at 4K. However, on the modern internet, this is probably pointless. Most viewers cannot view your stream in its full glory, forcing the streaming platform to transcode your stream down to 1080p.
* **Green-Screening** - technically called Chroma-Keying, this is the process of making parts of your image transparent, allowing you to superimpose the subject on a backdrop. Again, 4K is preferable for chroma-keying as there is a sharp transition between green and non-green pixels allowing for a clean chroma-key.
* **Content Reuse** - I highly recommend recording livestreams in the highest resolution possible. This allows you to repurpose your streams for other platforms. Reuse is less of an issue on YouTube with a landscape layout. However, when it comes to portrait media such as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok you need to be able to reframe your short and wide landscape content to be tall and thin portrait content.

### Clean HDMI Output

The camera must be able to output a clean HDMI image without custom firmware, and thus warranty-voiding firmware updates.

The Sony platform for webcam and I mean the HDMI alpha version, not the built in webcam that's built that can be accessed over USB. The quality frame rate and resolution tends to be quite poor. In these instances using the HDMI output is typically going to be a much stronger option
therefore, you know,

### Unlimited Runtime

Finally, the camera must be able to record or output to HDMI without overheating for unlimited time.

## Replacing (or adding to) my photography gear

Having a camera that can play double or even triple duty in your kit bag is invaluable. As a webcam and a stills photography camera, the α6600 allows me to make a larger investment product than if I was investing in separate units. I've owned the Nikon D5300 for three years at the point I bought the Sony, but I wanted more.

Having observed the downward trend of Digital SLR cameras and the growth of the Mirrorless Camera industry, seeing both a shift in camera bodies and lens availability, I was keen on dipping my toe into the mirrorless world. However, I know I'm not ready to get into the world of full-frame sensors, I started with crop sensors, and I feel like I get a lot out of these cameras.

you know for me I started in crop sensors I have a have shot with a Canon full frame and whilst I enjoy it, there's comes a cost with full frame so I think it's beneficial to have a crop sensor, even if only as your kind of secondary camera or your kind of more familiar camera for quick shots. Having a photography camera that is capable of interchangeable lenses. It's also important whilst you know modern phones are capable, far more capable of taking photographs for example, my Pixel six Pro has a 50 megapixel camera, which is almost twice that made over twice the megapixel capability over twice the resolution of a crop sensor the average crop sensor camera therefore that largely replaces the need for a pure point and shoot. However, there's also value in having a camera that is lightweight, but is equally capable of taking

the the other advantage of a crop sensor camera camera over a phone is typically mounting it and tripod is significantly easier. So if you are trying to take long exposure shots, whether that is long exposure for misting water moving water or whether that's even longer exposure and potentially mounting to a tracker to be able to track celestial bodies, that deep sky objects whether it's simply the stars or the planets, it's valuable to be able to mount the camera to something this is of course possible with a mobile phone and indeed you know with my Sony A 666 ASICs, the 600 and I actually have mounted cage on it anyway. This enables me additional mount points for other components such as spirit levels so so when I was selecting the camera I was really looking for something that had a nice sharp image quality interchangeable lenses. As I particularly want to get into more prime lenses I traditionally have had a couple of zoom lenses which suited me for the vast majority of cases however I was interested in in being able to shoot with wider apertures to get a shallower depth of field more artistic look into my shots rather than then being able to have like distractions in the background. I my photography style is is a fairly broad I do prefer to take portraits although I tend not to publish those landscapes and flowers in particular. So I was interested to be able to be able to switch out the lenses for different purposes. So as changeable lenses was was an essential element for me. Next I wanted something that had the capability to be able to shoot in a variety of circumstances and that typically means that it's a it's a lighter camera. I'm don't always use a tripod so the there's a lot of value in the in body image stabilisation available in the high end Sony crop sensor cameras now it's worth noting that the 6400 and the 6200 do not have in body image stabilisation. This is something that is limited to the top end of the APSC series. That's not to say that there is no image stabilisation possible in the lower end models. For example, a lot of lenses offer particularly Sony ones that offer optical image stabilisation.

### Autofocus

One of the interesting features of the Sony cameras over the last five years or so, particularly the mirrorless cameras, or only the mirrorless cameras is the vastly improved capability for auto focusing it detection face interaction for both pets and animals and humans. This is important as DSLRs in particular suffered from a limited capability to be able to scan for faces and quickly autofocus on them. You paragraph of course, this is limited to a certain extent by the speed of the lens. And you see this with Sony lenses in particular and then on the full frame variants G Master lenses are particularly fast auto focusing or particularly fast focusing which enables a very fast autofocus. It's worth understanding that the way autofocus tends to work is using contrast. So a auto focusing system on a camera will tend to shift in and out of focus to try and find the highest contrast picture it can within the scope of the frame. Now, Canon, Nikon and Sony in particular but other brands included have been in a constant arms race, trying to develop cameras which have faster and faster autofocus capabilities. Sony in the last few years has definitely come out at the top of that pile with the autofocus on Nikon and Canon both in the crop centre and the full frame sensor being a stronger option over the other two leading brands and I think a lot of this can be put down to the fact that Sony also develop a range of phones in the form of the experior range, which has enabled them access to better and more advanced compute modules enabling the application of artificial intelligence techniques to be able to identify elements of the picture that represent an eye or a face of either an animal or of a of a human

### Lens Availability

I'm a huge fan of prime lenses. This is a fairly recent fascination, largely in the last year where I've acquired a number of prime lenses for different purposes. My very first prime lens for the Sony camera with the Sigma F 1.4 16 millimetre lens. This is my primary webcam lens that I use on a day to day basis as a webcam but I also use it for landscape photography and in some cases, small kind of creative photography. Using low light in bed be able to get some shallow depth of field shots that can be quite artistic. The next lens that I picked up was a f 1.8 Sony 35 millimetre. So this isn't quite a pancake lens although it is very small compared to that Sigma lenses. This was my you know, primary videography lens in terms of live streaming, you know, larger groups of people or speakers on stage and a little bit more of a distance that can be achieved with the 16 millimetre lens, the slightly tighter focus and get the capability to operate in a sub optimal lighting inside for example, a church does give the capability of good producing a nice bright and clear image with a reasonable amount of background blur depth of 3d depth of field. The next lens that I bought was actually a full frame Sigma lens. So this is the 50 millimetre F 1.4 Sigma Art lens. So when attached to a Sony crop sensor, this represents roughly a 75 millimetre field of view or equivalent field of view of 75 millimetres and I use this this this has become my kind of primary nature photography lens so as I'm kind of wandering around and looking at plants and wildflowers and insects I'm often taking pictures using this lens so this is been a fantastic lens is really kind of improved my ability to be able to get up close to something and get a nice tight shots. There's also a fantastic lens for you know, taking landscape photography whereby you're not necessarily going to be able to get close to the subject. And my most recent acquisition was a sigma 70 millimetre macro lens again, this is a 50 millimetre sorry, a full frame lens at 70 millimetres that then represents a roughly 105 millimetre field of view and is specifically designed for macro capabilities. This has really allowed me to get close to that one to one representation of subjects that you know I've been kind of yearning for, for in my macro photography deeds. I feel that with these four prime lenses I can cover the vast majority of photography circumstances. This is something that I you know, I enjoy using these prime lenses a lot. I do somewhat miss having a better zoom lens I would particularly like something along the lines of a Tamron 24 to 400 millimetre lens. However, that's not yet available for the Sony email platform. As and when they do become available. They're actually quite keen on pricing the app in the future.

## Adding Videography to my arsenal

The final element owning the Sony Alpha 6600 comes down to its capability with video. So obviously for content creators video is an essential capability, then it's also valuable to replace often larger and clunkier video recorders or digital video recorders that became popular as I when I was a child really. I think it's very unlikely these days that anyone would go out and specifically buy a dedicated video camera. To record family events. There's still obviously a place in in cinema and semi professional work of using digital video recorders or even video cassette recorders to be able to gain a higher high level better. A stronger performance and capacity that you get with these devices. And obviously you know, a a personal video recorder of some variety does give you the capability of not overheating, which can often plague as mirrorless cameras. Although you know on many of the more recent devices, this has been reduced often you know, by operating using silicon that is operating at a smaller size smaller die size, thus producing less heat and consuming less power. The vast majority however, videos and content creation that I see is actually done with with cameras and often Sony cameras, which was a you know, big recommendation by virtue of the fact that the majority of content creators I spoke to were were using Sony cameras and I will say you know that the number is probably close to 60 So it's not the vast majority by any means. But and there are people who are using cannons in particular again, you know, pulling double duty with with cannons as a photography camera, as well as a videography camera. And potentially also a webcam and then other devices other other other components such as Pentax and Panasonic also played some kind of role in when I was choosing the Sony platform. The nice thing about this the current range of Sony Alpha, a 6000 cameras is is the capability to record in 4k. Now as I've mentioned before in the article this was important particularly for content repurposing. So as an example, if you record everything in Tedd ATP that means it has a vertical resolution of 101,080 pixels. Now those 1080 pixels whilst completely sufficient for HD for YouTube, it would start to cause a problem if you needed to reframe those into a portrait resolution. So for example, the minimum resolution in the in the vertical dimension for a tick tock video is insert whatever the it's insert whatever the number here is four 720 P and this is similar on other platforms although Instagram for example will actually accept lower resolutions although engagement may be low in that case because of the quality of the image. So you know it's important to to realise that 4k is not just about being able to upload something in 4k. It's also the ability to reuse this content in others other sources. Now of course the downside of 4k is that you are producing something that is going to be inherently large requires storage space. However, you know with things like HT six five you can significantly reduce the amount of storage space required which saves a small fortune in either cloud storage fees or or physical backups.
The in general the video quality on the Sony is exceptionally good particularly paired with a strong lens. You have a lot of capability to be able to record aesthetically pleasing video as well as the ability to operate in relatively low light conditions with with for example an F 1.2 or F 1.4 lens
the there is there is the the Asics 6600 does have the capability of recording in s log which is a particular colour gamut which allows for better representation of colours that are coming in to the camera in a digital format. The output of this is often looks quite muted and almost grey. However you can then apply a lookup table LUT which then allows you to be able to restore that kind of image to a much better representation of the of reality. So there's a lot of benefits in that it can be quite difficult to colour grade as log to as it's an additional step. So you do have to practice a bit to be able to understand how how that works and be able to produce a high quality image
