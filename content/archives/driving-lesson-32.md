**7 Days to Go** Funny old day today, made one sill mistake that if in a test would have been a fail. Spent a fair bit of time today parking in bays, started off at ASDA, who despite being in the empty part of the car park told Kev he could not teach learners in Car Parks. Went down to Marine Drive and had people driving behind us while trying to park in the bays. Anyway seem to have got he parking in bays quite well, did one perfectly by accident, still need to remember to keep checking behind me.
