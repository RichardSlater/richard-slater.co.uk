I am currently trying to diagnose several Windows XP SP2 computers with severe network problems, the bottleneck is in the network. Whilst deploying a group policy object the Windows Installer Service crashed due to a network time-out, and this was the resultant response from Error Reporting: [![Problem with Windows XP is Windows Vista](/img/archive/2007/08/problemwithvista.PNG)](/img/archive/2007/08/problemwithvista.PNG "Problem with Windows XP is Windows Vista") So there you go the problem with Windows XP is Windows Vista!
