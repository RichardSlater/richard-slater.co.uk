I am sure that title is going to annoy someone an awful lot, but never mind. \[\[Wikipedia:Richard Bartle\]\] submitted an [opinion piece](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/apr/28/games.censorship) to \[\[Wikipedia:The Guardian\]\] today, and as he puts it [in his blog](http://www.youhaventlived.com/qblog/2008/QBlog280408B.html) it is "Opinionated". I like it! I think it is something I had realised and accepted a long time ago (I was born in 1981) games are part of the norm for me. I learnt to program on a \[\[Wikipedia:ZX Spectrum\]\] when I was 8, what did I write - computer games of course - pong, breakout, \[\[Wikipedia:Thunderbirds (TV Series)\]\], rolling shooters. I even tried to write a Windows like \[\[Wikipedia:GUI\]\] in \[\[Wikipedia:BASIC\]\] (yes it had some serious design flaws). All of that was normal to me.
