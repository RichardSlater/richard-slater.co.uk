My degree isnt going to well, I got my transcript through for the most recent exams I took... I was dissapointed to say the least. - Comparative Programming Languages (56%) - Computer Enginering Concepts (43%) - Object Oriented Design and Implementation (48%) I have spent most of the afternoon figuring out what I need to get to be able to get which grades: Average 85% on all remaining exams and assessments to get a First Average 70% on all remaining exams and assessments to get a Upper Second Average 50% on all remaining exams and assessments to get a Lower Second Average 32% on all remaining exams and assessments to get a Third Average less than 32% on all remaining exams and assessments to Fail My point average for this year is 49.3% it was 51% for last year so I have to pull my grades up just to get a 2:2... and to get a 2:1 i have to pretty much ace everything else... I have got a long two months ahead of me. I want to cry.
