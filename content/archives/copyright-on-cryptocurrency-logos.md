Copyright in cryptocurrency is a complex topic, many crypto currencies are created by a corporate entity others by individuals. In some depending in some cases when the currency was created the associated logo was releasesd under a commercial licence requiring permission to use it, despite the fact the use of the logo may be "free marketing" for the copyright holder.

I'm going to collect together a list of logos and evidence of what licence they are released under in this post, hope it is of use to someone.

| Coin | Source of Logo                                                                        | Licence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
