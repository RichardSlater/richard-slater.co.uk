Found a [very useful tool](http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm) called ISORecorder for creating ISOs from CDs, it works well with daemon tools, and burns ISO images created with nLite, pretty good replacement for the ISO Burning portions of Nero. If you wanted a burning tool similar to Nero with the ability to add individual files and directories to a CD Image take a look at the free [CD Burner XP](http://www.cdburnerxp.se/). On a totaly different topic, there is a heated discussion going on over [here](http://www.oc-ps.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1903) about the relative merrits and disadvantages of Wireless Mice over Wired Mice... if you feel like a bit of an expert feel free to join in!
