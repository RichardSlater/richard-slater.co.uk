It is obviously the time of year for MMORPG betas at the moment, Wish 2 beta started on 1st January, City of Heros Europe started not long after and it looks like World of Warcraft Europe is on the horizon. It is very nice to see so many games taking the european market so seriously, games like Lineage II, CoH and WoW are going to mop up after SOE decided all european players would have to play on US servers. And for anyone who is interested, NCSoft have their offices in Brighton, UK so if you want a job take a look at their website. [\[link\]](http://www.plaync.com/jobs/jobs.html)
