Bought the game last week, finished the single player campaign a couple of days ago. It plays more like being in a film than a game, which for me is great, as a cinematic experience it is superb, the game play is better than any other game I have played before (which doesn't say much really - have been out of touch of the FPS market over the past few years).

The multiplayer is great fun too. I had some initial issues connecting in the first place due to PunkBuster connect issues, resolved them by [updating PunkBuster manualy with PBSetup.exe](http://www.evenbalance.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php) then running the game as Administrator under Vista 64.

All in all, great game - well worth the spend, and brought a lot of enjoyment to my Christmas.
