I found two [googlewhacks](https://web.archive.org/web/20040614150527/http://www.googlewhack.com/) today!
 - dyspraxic tiramisu
 - omniscient taramasalata
 
Of course by putting them on my website like this they are no longer going to be Googlewhacks. If you don't know what a Googlewhack is, it is two words from dictionary.com that when searched for on google.com it returns only one result. The result cant be a list, it must be something someone has actually typed... they usualy seem to be blogs actually, so maybe I am a googlewhack too!
