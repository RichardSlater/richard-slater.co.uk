Thanks to [Ian's Messy Desk](http://www.ismckenzie.com/2005/11/desktop_blogging_clients_1.html "Ian's Messy Desk") and [BlogWell](http://blogwell.wordpress.com/2007/03/17/using-wbloggar-for-wordpress-blogs/ "BlogWell") this post comes courtesy of [w.bloggar](http://www.wbloggar.com/ "w.bloggar"). Going to give this a go and see if I get on with it, shame it is not a WYSIWIG tool, but it seems to have some useful features.
