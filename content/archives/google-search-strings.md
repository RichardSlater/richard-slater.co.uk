Inspired by other similar posts on many other blogs I decided provide some answers to questions that people come to this blog via search engines with. Sorted in descending order of the number of requests ever. **lakeland revival** (with and without quotes and various prefixes and postfixes) - [My Post](/archives/2008/05/08/lakeland-revival/), [NewChristian.org](http://www.newchristian.org.uk/lakeland.html), [matthewblogroll](http://matthewblogroll.325mb.com/revivallakeland.html), Wikipedia's \[\[Wikipedia:Florida Healing Outpouring\]\] page **richard slater** - Yes that is me, there are more Richard Slaters though - you can find a list [at richardslater.com](http://www.richardslater.com/rslist.html)! **richard slater artist** - this isn't me unfortunatly, you may be looking for [this](http://www.stivessocietyofartists.com/slater/slater.htm) page. **lakeland revival online** - you can find out more information about the lakeland revival online at [god.tv](http://www.god.tv/florida) or on the [Fresh Fire Ministeries](http://www.freshfire.ca/) web page. **"http://localhost:port" "wikipedia"** \- I honestly haven't got a clue what the searcher was hoping to happen here someone searching for a way to host wikipedia on a local machine, for that there is a [Wikipedia CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Test_Version) available. **wedding aniversary** - Me and my wife got married on September 4th, if you are reading this why not tell me when yours is. **catherine worship leader lakeland revival** - I think you are probably looking for Catherine Mullins (who is a fantastic energetic worship leader at the revival, you can find more information on [Radiant God](http://radiantgod.blogspot.com/2008/06/catherine-mullins-breathe.html), [I Trust You](http://itrustyou.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/worship-leader-catherine-mullins/) and [Coweta Community Church](http://www.cowetacommunitychurch.org/Catherine-Mullins-v-36.html). **guitar lessons peacehaven** - you may want to have a look for Keith Markwick, apparantly he does guitar lessons in Peacehaven! **homeplug latency** - from experience it can be slow and laggy and is often considered unsuitable for gameing applications, however for e-mail and surfing it is fine. **inkscape** - that would be [here](http://www.inkscape.org/). **john piper lakeland** - John Piper has a website at [Desiring God](http://www.desiringgod.org/) however I don't know if he has anything to say about Lakeland! **liz calmiano** - her [Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/lizcalmianotextileart) is a good place to start. **mapin borrow cable crimper** - I don't think Maplin loan out equipment, you would have to buy it, I bought [this one](http://www.maplin.co.uk/Search.aspx?criteria=N87CU&DOY=27m7).
