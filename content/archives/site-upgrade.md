Upgraded the site to WordPress 2.6, also switched the style to use widgets so everything down the left hand side is now a widget rather than some hand coded SQL stuff, that worked but could have been much better, now it is! As you can probably see I am experementing with Twitter I don't know if I am going to get along with it, but I do like the idea of blogging with less than 140 characters. As always if anyone spots anything that is not as it should be do let me know and I will fix it, well try to, or perhaps phone a friend.
