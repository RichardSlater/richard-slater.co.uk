Nate Combs has again posted on \[\[Wikipedia:Terra Nova (blog)|Terra Nova\]\] about what makes [rare minerals rare](http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2007/09/scarcely-rare.html). Nate makes the very good point; that rare minerals are not as scarce as the name might suggest. It is well worth a read as his his [personal "scratchpad"](http://scratchpad.roaringshrimp.com/).
