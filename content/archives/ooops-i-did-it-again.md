Yes, it has come to that time of the year again that I remember that I was meant to be blogging more, in fact I made it a New Year's resolution to blog more often, and that came to absolutely nothing and here we are almost 9 months later. It has been a busy day, I have installed WordPress 2.2 both on here and on [I Married You](http://www.imarriedyou.co.uk/ "I Married You") and removed almost all of the old site for storage space reasons, the only part of my website that is still there is my [CS335 - Dissertation](/uploads/2007/08/dissertation.pdf "CS335 - Dissertation") which several people link to, so I thought it only fair not to move that one. I will look through my University Stuff and see if any of it is worth bringing across to WordPress. Work is going well, getting really stuck in to some cool stuff this year, commissioned a couple of new servers over the summer break which whilst mundane to most, to Systems Administrators it marks a progression in your environment, think of it as something akin to building another floor on your house or office block. Now I remember why I don't blog, I can't think of what to say! Well, not at the moment at least hopefully WordPress will make it easier to blog more regularly as I have the tools to do so without having to worry about phpBB and my hacked together blog script... oh and look RSS!
