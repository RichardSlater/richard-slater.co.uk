Excited dosn't even begin to explain how I am feeling about the climax of the current series of Dr. Who; I am not going to be able to watch it on the night so that is going to get to me even more knowing that I am going to have to wait an extra day to see the end of the series.

The thought that this episode explains how Christopher Eccleston comes to an end as The Doctor? how the Daleks managed to survive the time war? are the time lords still in existance? Aaagh so many questions.
