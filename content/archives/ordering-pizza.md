I know I have only just blogged, but this wouldn't fit in Twitter. Ordered a Pizza tonight from Famous Moe's Pizza, we ordered a large deep pan pizza with pineapple, sweetcorn & mushrooms; on the side we were going to have coleslaw, two sprites, garlic bread and \[\[Wikipedia:Häagen Dazs\]\]. Just had a phone call from said Pizza company who said they have no sweetcorn, coleslaw, sprites or Häagen Dazs. Leaving us with a pineapple and mushroom pizza with garlic bread... strangely enough I asked them to cancel the order and refund the money to me. In times when people are less likely to spend money on take-away it doesn't bode well for your business model to not have 70% of products in stock.
