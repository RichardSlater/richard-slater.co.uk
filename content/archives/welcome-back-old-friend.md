I have recently rediscovered a old friend, [Digiguide](https://web.archive.org/web/20071219185855/http://getdigiguide.com/?p=1&r=130332) I used to use it all the time before I went to university to remind me of when stuff I want to watch is on TV, however lack of TV meant that I wasn't quite so enthralled by the possability of having it back. However if you want an electronic TV guide that reminds you of what you want to watch then it is about as good as it gets. 

Seriously tempted to re-subscribe to this service, and just in case you were wondering yes you can have support for Video+ in digiguide, here's a link : [http://andrewcurrey.co.uk/download/vplus/](http://andrewcurrey.co.uk/download/vplus/)
