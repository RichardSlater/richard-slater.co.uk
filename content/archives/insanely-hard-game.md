I found this game called [Balm](http://thejab.com/newsite/balm.html), the plot is you have to rid a computer core of a virus, essentialy what you have are green discs (you) and red discs (computer). Each disc has a single tab on it which connects it to any other discs if that tab comes into contact with any other disc that is not of its colour the disc changes color to your colour, and follows any path from there. You can rotate any disc that is your own colour but only clockwise.

It is a very very simple concept, but very very hard to beat the AI.
