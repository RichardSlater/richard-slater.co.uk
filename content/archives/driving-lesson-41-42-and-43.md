Like last time in the run up to my test I have not blogged every single lesson, however after a week of Holiday and the last three lessons I am going to be taking my test again tomorrow at 14:32. I think I am ready to take the test, I felt that way last time - don't know if I was or not, I am not the person to judge that. However tomorrow we will find out what happens. I have come to the conclusion that the test is pretty much a sequence of events that you either deal with as the DSA deems to be correctly, or not. It's quite hard for me to get my mind around this method of testing, but that is they way it is to be. Will post with my results tomorrow.
