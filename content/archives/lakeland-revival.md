Catherine and I have been watching the [GOD channel](http://www.god.tv/) over the past three days, there has been and still is a great outpouring of the holy spirit in Lakeland, Florida, and the GOD channel have been broadcasting it to the world (well most of it). I don't know what God is going to do, but I am sure that he is changing lives there in Florida and all over the world through the ministries of the leaders there. It is not without [criticism](http://churchwarnings.blogspot.com/2008/05/todd-bentley-revival-in-lakeland-email.html), I don't know enough about everyone involved to make up my mind, chances are I will never know till I get to meet my Lord face to face.
