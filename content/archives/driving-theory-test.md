**I passed**. Had a good chat to the guy at the desk who did wonders to ease my nerves by being funny and blunt. I got 50 out of 50 for the multiple choice questions and 53 out of 75 for the hazard perception. Which according to [Kev](https://web.archive.org/web/20090421173352/http://www.snaildrive.co.uk/) is good, the pass mark for the hazard perception was 44.Â  I scored 6 for the double hazard clip, 5 on 3 clips, 4 on 4 clips, 3 on 4 clips and 2 on 2 clips. Which means that I was only below the pass mark on 2 clips.

The most annoying thing is there was absoloutely nothing about stopping distances in there, so all of my crazy maths to try and remember the distances was to no avail, maybe they will help someone else who has a odd mind like my own.
