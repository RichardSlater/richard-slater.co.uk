Had quite an enjoyable drive today, did four manovures first time round (reverse round a corner, reverse park, bay parking and turn in the road), that's not to say they were without error but they were passable. Almost didn't see a car driving round the Sainsbury's car park, Kev put his foot on the break at the same time I put the break down, he was faster though so I felt the pedal go out from underneath my foot. I was quite happy with the drive all in all, getting used to scanning the road, although I do find it hard work.
