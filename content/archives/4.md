Kings of Chaos is a web based Masivly Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG), create your army of Elves, Dwarfs, Humans or Orcs, build up your army to someday rule over all Chaos. I ended Age 2 at a rank of 28,490 before I sold all of my weapons to upgrade to Level 10 spies and retrain all of my Soldiers to Spies... not a fantastic rank, but I had only been playing half way through the age. Age 3 Beta has started, I have switched from Dwarves to Elves... my goal for the Beta is to figure out how this new age works, and perhaps build up a small army of defense soldiers, I might give spies a try if I get a chance... once Age 3 starts I plan to focus heavily on spies and my spy level.
