I don't have much time to blog today, so it is fortunate that much of what I described yesterday was practiced today. It was a narrower road and it was much harder to get it right. I have got the procedure down in my head now though, will need more practice but I am making progress.

Tomorrow is "driving a bit faster" which should be fun, not to0 fun mind... I am not one for speeding... intentionally.
