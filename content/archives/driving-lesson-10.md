20 hours of driving lessons completed now, and Kev and I took the time to go through the Driver's Record that the \[\[Wikipedia:Driving Standards Agency\]\] provides people who book a theory test for the first time. The Driver's Record is broken down into twenty driving skills and four other skills related to car ownership. You can read more about the [Driver's Record on direct.gov](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/PracticalTest/DG_4022483). Each of the 20 driving skills are rated between 1 and 5, where 1 is Introduced and 5 is independent without prompts from the driving instructor. In total I have one of the skills at level 5, three at level 4, twelve at level 3 none at level 2, two at level 1 and there are two that I have not looked at yet (emergency stops and parking). I am pleased with the progress I have made although I expect I will need another 40 hours of lessons before I will be close to being able to take my \[\[Wikipedia:United\_Kingdom\_driving\_test|practical test\]\]. Onto the actual content of the lesson, we spent some more time reversing round corners which along with turning round in the road, I find quite difficult. We also covered some more roundabouts and junctions both of which I am improving on, but still find difficult. Kev also taught me a technique for moving off faster, essentially it is moving from the step by step approach to moving off to being about to prepare to move off quickly. Here is the process I have been using up until now, taken from the safely stopped position (i.e. handbrake on and in neutral):

1.  push the clutch down
2.  change into first gear
3.  give the engine a bit of gas
4.  bring the clutch up to biting point
5.  put more gas on to get the revs back up
6.  check the internal mirror, right door mirror and right blind spot, only move on to the next step if it is safe.
7.  take the hand brake off
8.  keep feet in the same place until moving
9.  come off the clutch and add more gas until up to speed

The technique Kev taught me today was to combine 3, 4 and 5 with a single movement to bring the clutch up to biting point and the gas down to provide sufficient power from the engine. It was good fun, I don't think I have got it yet but I am improving. Unfortunately I haven't got a lesson until next Wednesday, I know how learners feel now if they have to wait a week between each lesson.
