I have decided to take a break from EVE and MMOGs in general, I say I have decided... I can't afford it at the moment so I havn't got a huge choice in the matter. I did get a chance to play [Guild Wars](http://www.guildwars.com/) for a weekend last weekend, which was a huge amount of fun.. not strictly a MMOG but it feels pretty good, kind of a cross between Lineage II and Phantasy Star Online. I have decided that I will use my time to re-design OcPS which has needed re-working for quite some time. And if I get really bored I have a month of Lineage II waiting for me in the box pack that I bought a couple of months back.
