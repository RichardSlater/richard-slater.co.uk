I was reading Pete's Images of Broken Light, specifically the [interesting post](https://web.archive.org/web/20090928020747/http://www.robotii.co.uk/archives/2007/09/12/microsoft-attacks-google-apps/) about Microsoft's public attitude towards [Google's Apps](https://workspace.google.com/), it seems fairly typical of modern corporate America to rubbish someone else technology, brushing over their own failings without a second thought.

I don't quite understand companies that do this, who are they targeting these comments at? Perhaps home users? surely they would use the free Google Apps Standard Edition as opposed to Microsoft Office Standard at £200 - £300, anyone could use Microsoft Office Live in the UK for free as well however it is still in "Beta" itself - how is that different from Google Apps "Beta". What about Enterprise decision makers, clearly a press release is going to swing the opinions for a multi million pound roll out of a particular productivity suite - or not. Perhaps it is just sour grapes, after all Office Live hasn't made nearly the impression I thought it was going to, certainly not in the UK.
