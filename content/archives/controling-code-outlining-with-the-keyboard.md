Code outlining is a feature of supported by Visual Studio and many other editors, MSDN has some good documentation for VS2005, [VS2008](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/td6a5x4s.aspx) and [VS2010](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/td6a5x4s(VS.100).aspx). If I were asked to explain this as briefly as possible, I would probably say:

> Code Outlining is the logical partitioning of code in such a way that the user interface, or editor, is able to selectively hide the body of the content (such as a class, struct, enum or method) whilst leaving the signature or some identifying comment visible.

You can see this in action in Visual Studio 2008 with the following Screenshot: ![CodeOutliningVS2008](/uploads/2009/11/CodeOutliningVS2008.png "CodeOutliningVS2008") I accidentally turned off Code Outlining today by hitting some keyboard shortcut that I didn't know how to reverse, this lead me to discover several useful keyboard shortcuts for managing the display of your code from the keyboard. As it turns out I managed to hit Ctrl-M followed by Ctrl-P (or just P in fact)Â which maps to Edit.StopOutlining, by default it seems that the Visual C# 2005 mapping scheme doesn't provide a shortcut to enable Automatic Outlining so instead you can access the command through Edit Menu -> Outlining -> Start Automatic Outlining. Enabled again, I get to play with code outlining from the keyboard:

*   To toggle (collapse an expanded block or expand a collapsed block) the closest outlined element use Ctrl-M followed by Ctrl-M.
*   To toggle everything use Ctrl-M followed by Ctrl-L (I find little use for this)
*   To collapse to definitions use Ctrl-M followed by Ctrl-O

The last one is the most useful when used in conjunction with [Regions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek.aspx) as after colapsing to definitions you will get something similar to this: ![ColapseToDefinitionsVS2008](/uploads/2009/11/ColapseToDefinitionsVS2008.png "ColapseToDefinitionsVS2008") You might have noticed in the first screenshot that CodeRush Xpress adds a coloured line between the beginning and end of blocks of code, this is a nice feature if you have long blocks of code, which of course you shouldn't have. ![CodeRushXpressBlockLines](/uploads/2009/11/CodeRushXpressBlockLines.png "CodeRushXpressBlockLines") There we go, an errant key stroke can lead to learning and blogging, who would have thought it?
