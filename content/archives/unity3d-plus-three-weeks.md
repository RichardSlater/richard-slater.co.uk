It is about 3 weeks on since I started learning Unity3d, and today [Makemedia](http://www.makemedia.com/) delivered the product we were working on using it. I have thoroughly enjoyed the process and the experience, there is still much to learn however I am much more confident experimenting with Unity3d to see what I can come up with. As I am not going out to see the fireworks tonight, I put together a 3d scene to demonstrate some of Unity Basics particle effects in the form of a personal fireworks display. Move around in the scene using W, A, S, D or the Arrow Keys you can move your head by moving the mouse.

Some of the rockets go a bit crazy some time and fire off into the distance at low speeds which is quite peculiar when it is towards the camera.
