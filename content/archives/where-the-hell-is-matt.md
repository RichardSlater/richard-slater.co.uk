I know this is quite old news really, but I had not seen this until it was linked on \[\[Wikipedia:Twitter\]\], so I thought I would blog it on the off chance that some one else hadn't seen it either. Essentially all it is three videos of some guy (\[\[Wikipedia:Matt Harding\]\]) who travels round the world recording short clips of him doing a little dance (very badly - his own words), each video has been set to the lyrics sung in a dieing \[\[Wikipedia:Solomon Islands\]\]. in the third, and most recent, video Matt is joined by thousands of people who wanted to dance with him. It sound really lame when I try and explain it all I can say is watch the videos it is worth it!

There is also a really interesting lecture by Matt in three parts on YouTube: [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z92o20KYH5g), [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z92o20KYH5g), [Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2m6cSTx76U).
