I have been meaning to post about this since I first heard about it, and spectacuarly didn't. As of Tuesday last week www.drhorrible.com was host to the first of three episodes of \[\[Wikipedia:Dr. Horrible\]\]'s Sing Along Blog. The title is great in itself, however as it has been said seeing is believing and honestly if you have enjoyed any of \[\[Wikipedia:Joss Whedon\]\]'s work then you will really love this. The mini-series covers a snapshot in the lives of Dr. Horrible (\[\[Wikipedia:Neil Patrick Harris\]\]) the protagonist and his arch-nemisis Captin Hammer (\[\[Wikipedia:Nathan Fillion\]\] of Firefly/Serenity fame). Unusally for Joss Whedon's work it dosn't have a strong feminist female character as such, however you will have to watch it to see why that may be! It is no longer available for free on the web, although US and Canadian iTunes users can download it, international iTunes users have been promised it Soonâ„¢ and a DVD and Soundtrack look pomising.
