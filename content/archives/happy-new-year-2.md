This is just a quick post to wish everyone a Happy New Year. I have been wanting to post some statistics gathered through [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for some time now so here we go. The following data covers 1st January 2008 until the post time 31st December 2008, all data excludes administrator visits and search engine crawlers. **Visit Statistics**

*   Visits: 3,066
*   Visitors: 2,708
*   Page Views: 4,935
*   Bounce Rate: 74.72%

**Top Visit Origins**

*   United Kingdom
*   United States

The main thing that I get from looking at those statistics is I would like to get the bounce rate down, the average time on site is only 51 seconds, which I would like to increase. The only way I can go about that is by creating more useful content and the only way to do that is to keep plugging at it. See you all in 2009!
