I have an exam tomorrow, Design of Communication Protocols (room W623), I have done little or no revision for it, because I have only turned up to three lectures because I have been ill, Saeed the lecturer failed repetedly to put the lecture notes up on the Internet... I don't know how he expects me to pass the module when he has failed those of us on the module who have not been able to attend the lecutures due to the extreme workload of the final year at University. There is nothing I can do now, except pray, but that has been distressing me as I am dwelling on the point. Todd Agnew - Grace Like Rain came on the Internet Radio and I just started praising God, there is nothing I can do now with the exam or the course or my degree as a whole... I trust everything to God's greater plan however hopless I may feel now, I must just raise my hands to the heavans and praise him for all he has given me. [Todd Agnew - Grace Like Rain](http://www.gracelikerain.com/) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found Was blind but now I see so clearly Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear And grace my fears relieved How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away When we've been there ten thousand years Bright shining as the sun We've no less days to sing Your praise Than when we first begun Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away
