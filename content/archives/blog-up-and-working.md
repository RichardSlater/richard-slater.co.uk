Yay... my blog is up and working... richard-slater.co.uk is getting neglected at the moment because I am working on [www.imarriedyou.co.uk](http://www.imarriedyou.co.uk/) which is the website for me and my fiancee... I will still post random blog stuff here though dont worry. Not that there is anyone reading this!
