I have spent most of the day messing arround with the blog, much of the work has gone on behind the scenes adding sitemap.org sitemaps to make spidering the site easier. Moving the links section to a menu so that it isn’t taking up valuable sidebar space and adding buttons to share posts on popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Linkedin and Technorati.

Tweaked the templates a bit more so that it didn’t just give snippits of articles on categories, archives and tag pages. Made the pagination slightly more useful you can now jump to any page, the same way you would be able to for Google.

I think that is all I have done, as ever if anyone spots any problems with any of the changes do let me know.
