[![](/img/archive/2008/10/drhorrible1.png "drhorrible1")](/img/archive/2008/10/drhorrible1.png) I promised myself I would blog about Dr. Horrible again once it was released on iTunes UK, it seems like an age since it was available for [free over the web](/archives/2008/07/22/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/), and then so quickly it disappeared again. It is however now available through iTunes UK, along with the sound track (which has been available for a few weeks now). Unfortunately I didn't pick it up on my RSS feeds until too late to download and watch tonight, hopefully get a chance to plug in and watch at the weekend.

Thank you Joss, Jed, Zach and Maurissa and everyone who plied their trade to bringing this story to life!
