If you missed it last night, you missed a bit of a treat... just in case some people haven't seen it yet I won't spoil the surprises. You can find the trailers and teasers for the whole series [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/video/index.shtml) On another note, Catherine and I are feeling much better, we haven't eaten much in the last couple of days so we are a little shakey on our feet, but on the mend. Hopefuly I will be well enough to go into work tomorrow.
