Catherine and I went to Center Parcs in the week just gone, having not been for a number of years we looked through the "Guest Information" pack which contained a couple of rather interestingly worded paragraphs. \[caption id="attachment\_196" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Don't Sleep In The Bolier Room"\][![Don't Sleep In The Bolier Room](/uploads/2008/08/dontsleepinboilerroom.jpg "CP08 Don't Sleep In The Bolier Room")](/uploads/2008/08/dontsleepinboilerroom.jpg)\[/caption\] I am facinated to know what events in the past have prompted Center Parcs UK to add this in the guest information. \[caption id="attachment\_197" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Open Fires"\][![Open Fires](/uploads/2008/08/openfires.jpg "CP08 - Open Fires")](/uploads/2008/08/openfires.jpg)\[/caption\] I think perhaps it would be good to note that there was not fireplace in our accommodation, so does this mean that if we bought a slow burning log we could burn it in the middle of the room? I thinks perhaps we will give that a miss.
