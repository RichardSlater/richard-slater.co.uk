In Europe at least, Twitter was [unable to come to an agreement](http://blog.twitter.com/2008/08/changes-for-some-sms-usersgood-and-bad.html) with mobile phone operators to continue to send incoming Tweets to mobile phones via SMS, at [least one person](https://web.archive.org/web/20080916141407/http://nick.piggott.name/blog/2008/08/18/twitter-and-the-realities-of-sms/) thinks that SMS is a deceptively profitable service for the network operators. Surely services that use SMS are going to generate more revenue as people pass funny Tweets onto non-Twitter users.

After all, all of those jokes that zip round like wildfire whenever something happens in the news aren't just the creative juices of the masses expressed in a short message, they are [written by the networks](https://web.archive.org/web/20080906143413/http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=11513) to encourage people to send more messages (by passing the jokes on).

All is not lost however, I have been using [jTwitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20081212173739/http://www.jtwitter.com/) for a long time and it does a great job of keeping me up to date on the move. The Twitter API seems good enough to allow anyone too interface with the service without extensive programming knowledge - I suspect we will see more services that allow access to Twitter from a mobile phone.
