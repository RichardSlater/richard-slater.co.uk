Since it became clear that I could not recover from Long-Covid on my own, I have been working with two Osteopaths to help support my recovery. There is quite a lot of experimentation involved in treatment. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence of treatments that work for all patients.

The information I am including here is for informational processes only. If you are also suffering from Long-Covid or any related conditions, please speak to healthcare professionals about building a routine that will work for you. My osteopaths have a [course available](https://thelonghaullounge.passion.io/) which I have been following, off the back of this course and weekly sessions with both Dan and Janie my breathing and sleep have improved.

| Time     | Activity / Therapy                                                                                             |

In the event that I can't get outside due to either poor health or poor weather, I use a [heat lamp](https://amzn.to/3sybkHU).

As you can see, there is a considerable amount of rest and sleep involved. Typically I am getting about *9 hours* of sleep a night. Then, taking numerous rest breaks during the day, interspersed with treatments and simple living tasks.

I hope that following this routine will help me overcome my Long-Covid and get back to some degree of normality.
