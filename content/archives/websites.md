I should mention to my faithful readers, I am not the only amature web developer in the family! My father seems to have a flair for imparting information through HTML. [daveslater.co.uk](http://www.daveslater.co.uk/) - chessproblems, countdown calculator and photo graphs! [imagesofjazz.co.uk](http://www.imagesofjazz.co.uk/) - my fathers next door neighbours website, with, strangely enough, images of jazz!
