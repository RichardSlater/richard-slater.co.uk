I am sure almost everyone in the whole world will have seen this as I got told by two friends, my RSS feeds and my wife almost simultaneously, which was a disturbing experience in itself. Google has [released](http://www.google.com/chrome) their own browser, Google made a rather amusing and informative [cartoon](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) too. There is pleanty of coverage from all of the usual suspects such as [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5044484/google-chrome-first-look), [Lifehacker (Again)](http://lifehacker.com/5044057/can-google-build-a-better-browser), [Official Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html) and [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/02/google_new_chrome_browser/). I am making the commitment to use Google Chrome for the Google Web Applications that I use, from what I have skim read about the product it is probably more suited than my add-on rich Firefox install (I do a fair amount of website coding, and even more debugging other peoples code - for which [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) is a must). I will try it for a week or two, see what it is like... it certainly seems faster than Firefox for browsing the web!
