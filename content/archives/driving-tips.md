The BBC has posted a list of 10 "driving tips" to make your driving experience more enjoyable and rewarding, the article has the added advantage of providing an insight into the day-to-day driving skills that people develop on thier own without any formal instruction. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7635486.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7635486.stm) I particuarly liked number 3 - "Make Eye Contact When You Can"; which is something I picked up a few years ago while walking around town making eye contact with people walking towards you often helped both parties to pass eachother without bumping or jostling. It is not something I had thought about with regard to driving, although I am going to try and put it into practice at pedestrian crossings if I get a chance.
