[Graeme Arthur](http://graemearthur.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/) tagged me, normally I hate these things but this is kind of a reverse chain letter... sort of... maybe if i re-write the rules slightly. **Rules:**

*   Link to the original tagger(s), and list these rules on my blog.
*   Share 7 facts about myself in the post - some random, some weird.
*   Tag 7 people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.
*   Let them know theyâ€™ve been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter.

**7 Facts About Me:**

1.  At the time of writing I have been alive for approximately 871 million seconds.
2.  I first started programming (in Spectrum BASIC) at about the age of 8 since then I have coded projects in \[\[Wikipedia:Visual Basic\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:Pascal (programming language)|Pascal\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:C (programming language)|C\]\]/\[\[Wikipedia:C++\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:Java (programming language)|Java\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:Ada (programming language)|Ada\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:PHP\]\] and \[\[Wikipedia:C-sharp (programming language)|C#\]\].
3.  I have played \[\[Wikipedia:EVE Online\]\] for almost five years now, have been playing less often of late however I still get to enjoy the time I do spend in EVE, although it is getting increasingly more and more lonely in space.
4.  I have been learning about \[\[Wikipedia:Sharepoint\]\] over the past few weeks, I have already completed most of the Microsoft e-Learning on the topic and read several blogs, I recently signed up to the [Sharepoint User Group UK](http://suguk.org/default.aspx).
5.  I wrote [my dissertation](/university/dissertation/Dissertation.pdf) on the future of \[\[Wikipedia:MMOG\]\]s, I disagree with a good proportion of what I wrote, however it was one of the most enjoyable parts of my Degree.
6.  I type at between 40 and 60 words per minute, it has taken me 5 minutes to get to 300 words in this blog post, some of them however were copied and pasted from Graeme's post.
7.  Like Graeme I also play bass (albeit I play badly) and dabble in live PA, although I don't really enjoy the later any more.

I know the last two were on Graeme's list, however I honestly can't think of anyone who would appreciate it most of the blogs I read are a strictly one way thing. I was tempted to link [JoCo](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/), [Felicia Day](http://feliciaday.com/) and [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/) - however I really don't think they would appreciate it.
