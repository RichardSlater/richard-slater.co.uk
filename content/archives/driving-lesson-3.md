Third driving lesson went really well, Kev taught me about hill starts specifically if you are going up the hill I need a little more gas than and keep the clutch just above the biting point when on the flat. When going down the hill the clutch can be fully depressed and thus the accelerator isn't needed, you can basically just roll down the hill - must remember to bringing the clutch up once I am moving as engine braking is actually quite substantial. I was taught to take some left and right turns on the roads round Woodingdean, which gave me a bit more of a challenge over the flat straight roads in Patcham. I stalled quite a few times as I got the pedal order when braking wrong, although I am improving - still haven't quite decoupled my feet yet to use them totally independently. I am pleased I am enjoying it more than I expected.
