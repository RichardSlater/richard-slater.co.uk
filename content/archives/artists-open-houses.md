Several of my friends and one of my colleagues are presenting their work at the [artists open houses](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2008/) as part of the [2008 Brighton Festival](http://www.brightonfestival.org/). In no particular order other than that of the Fiveways Artists Group trail listing:

 - Rex Matthews - A colleague of mine.
 - Deborah Fleming   - A friend from church, who is also displaying work with [Liz Calmiano](http://www.myspace.com/lizcalmianotextileart) and Maureen Hawthorne.
 
Impressed with how creative everyone is!
