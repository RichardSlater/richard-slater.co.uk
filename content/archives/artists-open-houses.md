Several of my friends and one of my colleagues are presenting their work at the [artists open houses](http://www.aoh.org.uk/2008/) as part of the [2008 Brighton Festival](http://www.brightonfestival.org/). In no particular order other than that of the [Fiveways Artists Group](htthttp://www.fivewaysartists.com/) trail listing:

 - [Rex Matthews](http://www.fivewaysartists.com/artist.php?page=profile&id=29) - A colleague of mine.
 - [Deborah Fleming](http://www.fivewaysartists.com/artist.php?page=profile&id=56) - A friend from church, who is also displaying work with [Liz Calmiano](http://www.myspace.com/lizcalmianotextileart) and Maureen Hawthorne.
 
Impressed with how creative everyone is!
