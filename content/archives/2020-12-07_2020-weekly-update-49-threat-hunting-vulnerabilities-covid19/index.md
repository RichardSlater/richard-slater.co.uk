### Threat Hunting with JARM

SANS comes through with an article on using JARM to hunt threats; this is an area I have started getting interested in given the increased threat landscape we find ourselves in.

### If you know code is vulnerable, would you ship it?

Dark Reading goes into some detail on the critical factors why vulnerable code is shipped in the first place.

[Why Vulnerable Code Is Shipped Knowingly](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/why-vulnerable-code-is-shipped-knowingly/a/d-id/1339373?_mc=rss_x_drr_edt_aud_dr_x_x-rss-simple)

### COVID-19 Drives Infosec in 2020 and beyond

Coronavirus has attacked every aspect of our lives, it’s changed they way we work and the way we engage with the world around us; this is unlikely to change in 2021 so prepare now.

### Bandook Resurrected from the dead

Bandook has seemingly returned from the dead and used to target numerous industries; this is interesting as it shows that old tools once presumed dead can be used in new and creative theatres.

### DNS Spoofing “uncommon” but on the rise

DNS Spoofing doesn’t happen that often, but when it does it can be very damaging; The Register points out that twice nearly nothing is still nearly nothing.

### Shipping related phishing

Phishing isn’t new; however attacking shipping related messages is starting to become a significant problem. This is an area where suppliers need to innovate and move away from inherently vulnerable platforms such as SMS for delivery shipping notifications.

### Cayman Islands investment fund data breach (Azure)

Yikes! glad I don’t have any cash stored in the Cayman Islands as they just accidentally left them out in the open in an unsecured Azure Blob Storage account; obviously they have been ignoring those pesky Azure Security Centre warnings.

### Double Extortion

So you’ve paid up, you think your clear; but are you? If you pay a ransom do you have any guarantees that your data has been destroyed. It’s not exactly like your dealing with a reputable thief here.

### Pre-filled PayPal MageCart attack

Retail scams aren’t going away any time soon; they are going to gain more “finesse” though — here is a good example of pre-filling a form which increases “conversions” and thus hacked accounts.

### Computer Fraud and Misuse Act supreme court test case

We should find out soon how enforceable various computer fraud acts really are soon; this is valuable test case data for all common law countries as it’s only when you try these cases in court we find out if they are actually enforceable.

### Attacks on Unprotected Docker Servers

Another tip for DevOps and Sys. Admins alike sometimes what you think is safe, is really the beach head an attacker needs.

### Using DNS Filtering to protect against Malware and Phishing

DNS filtering is a blunt tool; however it can be very effective when you have limited control over the operating system.

### Assessing your own Cyber Security Risk

Cyber Security is everyone’s problem; and now there is an app for that…

### Apple Over-the-air Denial of Service Fixed in iOS 13.5

This was the big post of the week; a researcher successfully demonstrated that it was possible to takeover unpatched iPhones using some simple (but hard to control) components.

### Risk Based Cyber Security

As we mature as an industry, we need to start considering how we mature our approach; taking a risk adaptive approach and truly understanding threat models is part of that process.
