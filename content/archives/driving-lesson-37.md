I am getting slack updating the blog, I had my first lesson after my driving test yesterday, in an odd kind of way I actually felt more confident. I know I failed the test however having someone else in the car and not having it all go totally wrong gave me some confidence. The lesson yesterday basically involved driving round finding places to do manoeuves, I make a point of saying "finding" as it was strangely difficult - at one point a van driver decided to park on the corner I was in the process of reversing round, amusingly enough he even nodded and smiled at us. Anyway, should be doing some more lessons over the coming weeks I will try and keep up with the updates, thanks for the comments, texts and tweets regarding my test.
