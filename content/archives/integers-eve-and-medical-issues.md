PHP Integers are really getting on my nerves at the moment, it seems that anything more than 32-bits is just plain not supported in PHP… to be honest that is awful… that is the most apauling degree of accuracy I have come across since BASIC. Oh well never mind rant over.

I am having lots of fun playing EVE and writing my dissertation, it is quite interesting researching the history of MMOGs, something that facinates me while being technical and worthy of a dissertation. Need to crack on with the dissertation bit though 5 days to go… should be fine, pleanty of time.

My stomach seems to be a lot better recently, I havnt had the same acid indegestion problems that I have been having the last week or so, I am still going to talk to the doctor see if there is anything that they can do by way of investigating what the problem might be. I am petrified it might be something serious or not even something serous… just something that would cause me to have to go onto a special diet… its hard enough work not eating meat products and still making interesting food without having to avoid other ingredients too… we will see.
