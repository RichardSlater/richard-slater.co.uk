We had some friends down at the end of last week, and they both have FaceBook accounts (or is that FaceBooks, or Faces, or FaceBook Profile pages. They use FaceBook in other words) so Catherine signed up, then I signed up, then I spent an hour deciding what I wanted my permissions to be. I have finally settled on a partiuar group of settings that I like to call "Totally Paranoid", everything is set to only be visible to "My Friends" including search, you will have to contact me outside FaceBook unless you are entirely better at Social Networking than I am and can still send me a Friend Request. On a lighter note this post should be published on FaceBook via Flog. Back to work tomorrow, so both Blogging and FaceBook activity will low, all good fun though!
