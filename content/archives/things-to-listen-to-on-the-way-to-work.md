I spend about an hour and a half on the bus every day commuting to and from work. It was a huge boon for me when I got my HTC Desire as it opened up the world of [Google Listen](http://listen.googlelabs.com/). I wanted to go through some of the Podcasts that I listen to in the hope that someone else in my position can enjoy them and hopefuly learn as much from them as I have: **Software Development / Programming**

*   [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) - one of the best produced .NET podcasts out there, Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell. All topics related to the .NET Platform and software development in general.
*   [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/) - Scott Hanselman is a Microsoft Developer, Family Man and general Geek, podcasts are of a concise and casual nature covering mainly programming matters, but sometimes branching out into other areas of Scott's interests.
*   [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com) - kind of reminds me of the Spanish Inquisition (which I remember well...) many hosts one topic or guest. The shows can be a little long.
*   [SitePoint Podcast](http://blogs.sitepoint.com/category/podcast/) - a fairly new addition to my listening list, I am not convinced on the format but there have been some good shows.
*   [Sparkling Client](http://www.sparklingclient.com/) - is short, really short. Which is great as the information is presented clearly and quickly, very programmer like. Makes me happy to see it appear on my List.

**Entertainment**

*   [This Developers Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) - modelled after This American Life some podcast I have never heard of, hosted by Scott Hanselman and Rob Conery; it is different, it's not information its about experience it is also fairly new and has music.
*   [Escape Pod](http://) - Sci-Fi podcast and blog, what can I say... I love Sci-Fi. Have a listen some of the stories are absolutely fantastic, well worth a listen.

So if you have the time to try some of these give them a go, let me know what you think and what else you find.
