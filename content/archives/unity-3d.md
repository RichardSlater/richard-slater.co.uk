I am starting a project next week using Unity3D, I have known about this for a while and have poked around a bit to try and figure out how to do various things. I have been really impressed as to how fast you can get something done with what is basically a free product. There are some superb videos on [Unity3d Student](http://unity3dstudent.com/) which have been invaluable. I think I have got my head around the controls, UI, paradigms and scripting, although not all in one scene. As evidence of my work I have made three balls bounce around the screen, something akin to a carpenter making a door stop perhaps, but I am sure I will learn. \[WP\_UnityObject src="/unity/bounce/WebPlayer.unity3d" width="550" /\]
