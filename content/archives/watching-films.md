I spent some selfish time on Tuesday watching \[\[Wikipedia:Donnie Darko\]\]. I wasn't giving the film my full attention so I had to watch it again, in between I spent some time on [the website](http://donniedarkofilm.com/) and reading [the FAQ](http://www.stainlesssteelrat.net/ddfaq.htm) both of which are well worth going through, however they are full of spoilers, so best to watch the film first. Anyway, watching the film re-kindled my love of watching films with a complex plot, films like \[\[Wikipedia:WALL-E\]\], \[\[Wikipedia:The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight\]\] and \[\[Wikipedia:Iron Man (film)|Iron Man\]\] are great to watch, however you hardly leave the cinema wondering what just happened... in a good way. It is a fine balance between creating a film that totally confuses, and makes you think. The one thing that has stuck out from talking to people about it is that it doesn't make much sense if you look at it in \[\[Wikipedia:linear time\]\], what we watch in the film is the final iteration. I won't say much more as I am sure there are people who haven't seen it before. The final upshot of watching spending selfish time is I went on the hunt for other things to watch in the evenings, these are three of the best \[\[Wikipedia:Computer-generated\_imagery|CGI\]\] Animated Shorts I have seen over the past few days, sorry about the YouTube quality, it is the best I could find:
