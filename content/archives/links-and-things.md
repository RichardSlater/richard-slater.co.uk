If you are so inclined I have created a page full of things that I find on the Internet, at the moment it isn't very full as I am in the process of going through my bookmarks and deciding what I want and what I don't want, things that I keep go on the list (if it is appropriate). Anyway [take a look](/things/) and let me know what you think!
