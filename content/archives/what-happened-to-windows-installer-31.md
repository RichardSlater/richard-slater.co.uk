n Aprils raft of patches, hotfixes and updates delivered via SUS, WSUS or Windows Update; Microsoft chose to release Windows Installer 3.1 the updated version of the install engine Microsoft has been pushing for the last 2 years.

However at the beginning of the week [Steven Bink of bink.nu noticed](https://web.archive.org/web/20050507103813/http://bink.nu/Article3882.bink) that the update had been pulled from SUS, further inspection showed that it had in fact gone totaly missing from the Microsoft Website. Many have pointed to [KB Article 898628](https://web.archive.org/web/20050621011043/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/898628/)

This blunder by Microsoft could cause some major headaches for IT Administrators who rely of Group Policy Software Management to install and update software throughout their enterprise.
