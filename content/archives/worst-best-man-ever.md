If prizes were handed out for those people who were the worst at partular roles in life I think I would probably be up there in the Worst Best Man chart. Yesterday evening Catherine was in pain, really suffering from something... so I phoned the doctor who says it sounds much like [gastroenteritis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis), all she could suggest was that she gets pleanty of fluid and doesn't eat anything... so this morning I wake up at about 5AM in major pain... oh crap!

Yes you guessed it... I am suffering from the same thing that Catherine was suffering last night, so much for paintball (so much for anything in fact) I now feel like the worst best man in the world, because I can't even manage to make it to the groom's stag do!
