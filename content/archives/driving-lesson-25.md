First lesson in two weeks, for that matter I don't get another lesson for two weeks either. I feel a little stuck with the driving to be honest, each lesson seems similar to the previous lesson, it is possibly a mix of the law of \[\[Wikipedia:diminishing returns\]\] and fustration at doing the same thing over and over again. Took a look at the Burgess Hill Test Center the website still says no information available, and I can't seem to select any times or dates on the "book a test" page on direct.gov. Never mind, hopefuly will be able to book a test at some point in 2009! Anyway, as I said no more lessons for two weeks because of Christmas, will update again then for sure.
