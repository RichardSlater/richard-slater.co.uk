I had been intending to post up all sorts of bits of news about life, driving, programming and cats but it didn't happen. I have been busy which is good, however it doesn't leave very much room for blogging. This post is going to be one really quick catch up entry to try and get me back into the swing of it. I finally passed my **driving** test at the beginning of the summer, it was my fourth try and I passed with three minors which was a great feeling... since then I have driven once, as part of PassPlus, which didn't really feel vastly different, although it was more enjoyable knowing that I didn't have a test coming up. Catherine and I have decided to wait for a bit before we get a car so we can assess what Catherine will need in terms of model and adaptations in a car to allow her to get the most out of it. ![Zoe and Kerry](/uploads/2009/10/0014.png "Zoe and Kerry")Sadly Kerry, [Zoe's](/archives/2009/04/17/zoe/) sister died a few months after Zoe, as a family we weren't ready to lose her, although it wouldn't have been fair to let her suffer an operation that might not help anyway, so my parents decided it was best to have her put down. My brother and I got a chance to say good bye to her, she wasn't her normal self and was in a lot of pain. We are all very sad. In **programming** land I spent last weekend learning SQL Server Integration Services and this weekend I plan to get into Analysis Services. Have been doing some utility programming at work to automate some of the file server operations we do, I am trying to automate as much as possible using something similar to duck tape programming to free me up to do more programming to create a more unified and friendly framework for managing the school network. Started using [CodeRush Xpress](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/dd218053.aspx) both at home and at work. In **sys. admin** world I have been continuing to use and learn Windows 7, I now have RTM installed at work still waiting for RTM to arrive at home on or around the 22nd. Been reading and listening to various resources surrounding Windows 2008 R2 particularly some excellent podcasts on [RunAs radio](http://www.runasradio.com/).
