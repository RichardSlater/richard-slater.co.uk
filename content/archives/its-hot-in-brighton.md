Whilst some of the country is suffering [flash floods and landslides](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/4109692.stm), Brighton is boiling hot... fortunatly I work in a basement which keeps it quite cool for the moment, however last night was excruciatingly hot even with a fan on. On another note, I think I am going to have to take a crash course in Microsoft Internet Information Services, as it is perfectly clear it has changed quite a bit since IIS4 (I believe it was re-written for IIS6) either way, I feel a little lost in it at the moment, all the functions are there... they are just in the wrong place.
