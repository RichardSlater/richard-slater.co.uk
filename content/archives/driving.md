I have had my Provisional driving licence for some time now, however I have done little or nothing about it since the idea of driving doesn't exactly fill me with joy. I don't know why that is but never the less I don't particularly want to spend the time and money on learning to drive. That said, it would make sense now Catherine and I are living in Peacehaven to be able to drive, it would also open up more job opportunities for me as I would be able to travel further than the bus can carry me, as well as being able to drive company cars and the such. Well as it turns out I booked my theory test, so I have a little over a month to learn everything I can about the theory test and driving in general, then after Catherine and I get back from holiday I can start on lessons with my [good friend Kev](http://www.snaildrive.co.uk/)! Fun Stuff!
