Creating content can be a thankless task. However, it is a way of giving back, building a better internet, and something enjoyable to do in my spare time. Therefore, if you feel moved to support me financially, either as a one-off or a monthly donation, you will enable me to spend more time focusing on creating new content.

## Support me financially

You can contribute directly to me with either Ko-Fi or Patreon.

- Could you buy me a coffee [with Ko-Fi?](https://ko-fi.com/richardslater)
- Would you be willing to contribute monthly [with Patreon?](https://www.patreon.com/richardslater)
