I don't get paid to create content; if you feel that my content has benefited you enough to earn a tip or donation, I would be eternally grateful of your support.

## Support me financially

You can contribute directly to me with either Ko-Fi or Patreon.

- Could you buy me a coffee [with Ko-Fi?](https://ko-fi.com/richardslater)
- Would you be willing to contribute monthly [with Patreon?](https://www.patreon.com/richardslater)
