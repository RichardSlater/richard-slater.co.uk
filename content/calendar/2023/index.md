## About

I've been creating AI art for about a year now, in that time several friends asked for copies. I put this calendar together, initially to share with the handful of friends who enjoy my art. I generated all of the art in the calendar using Stable Diffusion on Google Colaboratory with the following parameters:

 - *Steps*: 50
 - *Sampler*: k_lms
 - *CFG Scale*: 7.5

Each image was gengerated at 640x1088 px then upscaled using [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) then edited extensively in Adobe Photoshop to remove inconsistencies and errors. In theory given all of the information on this page you could re-generate the images, although not with my manual edits.

Most images required many hundreds of iterations in Stable Diffusion as some of the generated images didn't fit my artistic goals. In many cases the images were uninteresting or just plain broken - iteration is the key with AI generated art. Practically the whole process took much longer than planned, due to only being able to spend a 10-20 minutes a day on the project because of the effects of Long-COVID.
